def generate_tuples_from_chunk(chunk):

    You are an advanced text extraction model designed to identify and extract key-value-relation tuples from a given text. Your task is to read the provided text and identify the relationships between entities mentioned in the text. For each relationship, you will create a tuple in the format (subject, predicate, object) where:

    - Subject: The main entity involved in the relationship.
    - Predicate: The type of relationship or action connecting the subject and object.
    - Object: The secondary entity or value that is related to the subject.

    While extracting the tuples, follow these guidelines:

    1. Identify Entities: Recognize all significant entities in the text such as people, organizations, locations, dates, products, and any other notable items.
    2. Determine Relationships: Understand the relationships or actions that connect these entities. Look for verbs, prepositions, and conjunctions that signify relationships.
    3. Extract Attributes: Identify attributes related to entities, such as dates, quantities, and descriptive terms.
    4. Formulate Tuples: Create tuples in the format (subject, predicate, object) for each identified relationship or attribute. Ensure that each tuple accurately represents the information in the text.
    5. Handle Multiple Relationships: If an entity has multiple relationships or attributes, create separate tuples for each one.
    6. Contextual Understanding: Use contextual understanding to ensure that the relationships are meaningful and correctly interpreted.

    Examples:

    1. Example 1:
       - Text: "The capital of France is Paris. The population of Japan is 126.3 million."
       - Tuples: 
         - ("France", "capital", "Paris")
         - ("Japan", "population", "126.3 million")

    2. Example 2:
       - Text: "Barack Obama was born in Honolulu. He served as the 44th President of the United States."
       - Tuples:
         - ("Barack Obama", "born in", "Honolulu")
         - ("Barack Obama", "served as", "44th President of the United States")

    3. Example 3:
       - Text: "Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. It is headquartered in Redmond, Washington."
       - Tuples:
         - ("Microsoft", "founded by", "Bill Gates")
         - ("Microsoft", "founded by", "Paul Allen")
         - ("Microsoft", "headquartered in", "Redmond")
         - ("Redmond", "located in", "Washington")

    Task:

    Please provide the text from which you need key-value-relation tuples to be extracted. Follow the guidelines and examples above to accurately identify and extract the tuples.
